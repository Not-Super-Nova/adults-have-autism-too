## What is Autism?
Autism is "a range of neurodevelopmental conditions generally characterized by difficulties in social interactions and communication, repetitive behaviours, intense interests, and unusual reponses to sensory stimuli". (**wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum** - [this version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1102184134))

While Autism is often diagnosed in early to mid childhood, it's lifelong and can range from nearly invisible to completely life-changning.
