## What is Autism?
Autism is "a range of neurodevelopmental conditions generally characterized by difficulties in social interactions and communication, repetitive behaviours, intense interests, and unusual reponses to sensory stimuli". (**wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum** - [this version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1102184134))

While Autism is often diagnosed in early to mid childhood, it's lifelong and can range from nearly invisible to completely life-changning.

## How does Autism affect me?
I don't know. Autism affects different people differently. Here are some common symptoms that you may, or may not, experience. ***This is not medical advice, please speak to a qualified medical professional for advice.***

- Trouble understanding other people
- Anxiety in / about social situations
- Trouble making / keeping friends, or preferring solidarity
- Being percieved as blunt or rude without meaning to
- Finding it hard to say how you feel
- Trouble understanding sarcasm or common phrases (specifically by taking them too literally)
- Fondness for rythm and routine day to day.
- Not understanding social rules
- Avoiding eye contact
- Getting too close to people without realising
- Discomfort with people being too close / touching you
- Having an "eye for detail", seeing patterns, hearing sounds, and smelling things that others don't notice
