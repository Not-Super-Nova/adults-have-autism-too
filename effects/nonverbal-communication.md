# Non-Verbal Communication
Autistic people often have problems with non-verbal communication, such as holding eye contact, the effect of posture on conversation, and physical proximity.
While there are sections for coping strategies for when you ***absolutely*** have to fit in, it's generally recommended to avoid reliance on non-verbal communication with friends and family, by explaining to them you find it difficult.
## Trouble keeping eye contact
You may feel like you don't know which eye to look at, or where on someones face. You may also feel uncomfortable when keeping eye contact.
This can cause issues when communicating with neuro-typical people as some place a great deal of importance in keeping eye contact as a form of respect.

### Coping strategies
For discomfort with holding eye contact, you may find some luck with finding a part of their face that you can look at without the same significance, such as the nose. This may not work, however, so consider just avoiding eye-contact and disclosing why if and when they ask.
If you just don't know *where* to look on someones face, it's generally a good idea to pick a component of their face such as nose / between the eyebrows and stick with it. It's a lot harder to notice a slight misalignment than constant movement.
